Summary: This article discusses a specific scenario and solution for the error "Apache2 service cannot start. Specific error: 1."

---------

When configuring the Apache service on a Windows system, you may encounter the following error:

```
Apache2 service cannot start.
Specific error: 1.
Type NET HELPMSG 3547 for more help.
```

This error can be caused by various reasons. Today, I discovered that incorrect usage of comments in the configuration file can also lead to this issue. In the `httpd.conf` configuration file, comments must start with `#` and must be placed on a separate line. If a comment is written on the same line as a configuration directive, it can cause the above startup issue. The solution is to place all comments on separate lines.

This is just one possible cause of the startup failure. I hope this provides some ideas and assistance to those encountering this problem.
