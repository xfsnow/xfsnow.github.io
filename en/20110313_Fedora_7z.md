Summary: Introduce how to solve the "Cannot find 7z" issue with Fedora LiveUSB Creator on Windows.

---------

## Problem Description

Fedora has a LiveUSB Creator tool that can easily create a USB bootable drive from a Fedora system installation image. Note that you should only download it from the official website below, as versions from other websites may contain viruses!

This tool is actually quite simple. Although what you download is an installer, you don't need to run the installation. You can directly extract it with tools like WinRAR and then run liveusb-creator.exe.

## Issue Symptoms

Although the extracted program can run, it will report an error when executed:

```
Cannot find 7z.

Make sure to extract the entire liveusb-creator zip file before running this program.

LiveUSB creation failed!
```

## Solution

After checking feedback on Fedora's own website:

<https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/ticket/473>

It turns out that the current version of Windows has path restrictions. The entire program must be placed in the directory:

```
C:/Program Files/LiveUSB Creator/
```

to run properly. So whether you extract it yourself to run, or run the installer, you must ensure it's installed in the above path. Other paths won't work.
