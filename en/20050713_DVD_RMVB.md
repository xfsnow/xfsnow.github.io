Summary: Recently I learned a more convenient method using Gordian Knot + AVS: 1. GDIndex generates D2V project files from DVD VOB files, while extracting audio into AC3 audio files; 2. BeSweet converts AC3 audio to MP3; 3. AVS merges the above D2V and MP3 together, and this AVS can be directly compressed into RMVB files using RM tools, done.
