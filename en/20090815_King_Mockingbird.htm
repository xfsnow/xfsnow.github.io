He readily throws people into dungeons (using buttons and trapdoors to make them fall into dungeons), even his trusted police chief cannot escape this fate. He is lame and cross-eyed. The painters who portrait him either fall into dungeons for painting too realistically (including his legs and eyes) or for painting too idealistically (perfect portrait). Ironically, the real king is also thrown into the dungeon by the painted king (very much like Louis XIV). The fake king has exactly the same temper and personality as the real king. He forces a shepherdess in a painting to marry him, but the girl loves a chimney sweep boy in another painting. With the help of the mockingbird, the girl and the boy temporarily escape from their pursuers, but eventually, they are captured when the bird is caught, and both the boy and the bird are imprisoned. They unite with the common people there and break out of the dungeon, overthrowing the king during his wedding with the shepherdess. </p><p>It is said that French animation master Paul Grimault started in 1953 and spent five years of his heart and soul making this animated feature film. Eventually, he had to painfully abandon it due to financial reasons. It wasn't until more than twenty years later that this animation, which perfectly combines romantic fairy tales with the cruel French Revolution, was completed with the help of other directors and released in 1979. The film immediately became a classic of modern animated movies after its release. It moved not only the world's most famous animation master Hayao Miyazaki today, but also a whole generation of teenagers who watched it. With the dubbing by Shanghai Translation Studio's voice artists, it becomes even more unforgettable. Bi Ke voiced the mockingbird, the soul of the film. Sometimes passionate and eloquent, sometimes kind and magnanimous, his deep and magnetic voice is as dramatic as the bird's courageous wit. Shang Hua voiced the king with "Hard labor, hard labor is the best freedom." Arrogant, greedy, and selfish, such a character has no real emotions; he pursues nothing but the vanity of "the book says the king should be with the shepherdess." Yu Ding voiced the stone old man; with just a few lines "My experience is absolutely reliable..." he seems to have seen through thousands of layers of marriages in the world, but he never thought that in this world, there is always a happiness that can become possible if you persist. Tong Zi Rong and Ding Jian Hua voiced the poor chimney sweep boy and the shepherdess, truly a perfect match.</p></main><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="footer-content"><div class="footer-section"><h3><i class="fas fa-snowflake"></i> Snowpeak</h3><p>Sharing and discussing cutting-edge technologies of AI and cloud computing, and other interesting topics.</p><div class="social-links"><div class="social-platforms"><a href="https://github.com/xfsnow" target="_blank" class="social-link"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a><a href="https://snowpeak.blog.csdn.net/" target="_blank" class="social-link"><i class="fas fa-blog"></i></a><a href="https://space.bilibili.com/701839928" target="_blank" class="social-link"><i class="fab fa-bilibili"></i></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/snowpeak" target="_blank" class="social-link"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></div><div class="wechat-section"><div class="wechat-info"><span class="wechat-label">WeChat Account</span><span class="wechat-name">Tech Warm Life</span></div><img src="/assets/img/techwarm.jpg" alt="Tech Warm Life" class="wechat-qr"></div></div></div><div class="footer-section"><h4>Quick Links</h4><ul><li><a href="/#articles">Article</a></li><li><a href="/#tools">Tools</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-section"><h4>Tech Stack</h4><ul><li>Python</li><li>GitHub Copilot</li><li>Claude Sonnet 4</li><li>HTML/CSS/JS</li><li>Responsive Design</li></ul></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>Copyright &copy; 2013-<script>document.write((new Date()).getFullYear());</script> Snowpeak Blog.
