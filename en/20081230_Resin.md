I Installed resin-pro-3.1.8 on Windows 2003 Server Simplified Chinese version. I found all error messages were garbled.   
I changed the resin.conf in the resin installation directory.   
```conf
<javac compiler="internal" args="-source 1.5"/>   
```
to   
```conf
<javac compiler="javac" args="-source 1.5"/>   
```

That fixed the issue. Moreover, since the locally installed JDK is the Chinese version, the compilation errors are now returned in Chinese from `javac`!
