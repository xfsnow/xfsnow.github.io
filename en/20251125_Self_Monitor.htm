Users who deploy multi-cloud solutions also don't want to be locked into a single provider. Building a monitoring system using mainstream open-source software based on cloud platform IaaS services is an operations best practice.</p><p>This article uses AWS cloud as an example to introduce how to build a global resource monitoring system without managed services. Other cloud platforms follow similar approaches.</p><p><strong>Core Objective</strong>: Monitor AWS infrastructure resource health and self-hosted digital system operational status, with no managed service dependencies, global high availability, and 99.99% availability.</p><h2>1. Core Design Boundaries and Principles</h2><h3>1. Monitoring Targets (Clearly Focused)</h3><ul><li><strong>AWS Infrastructure Resources</strong>: EC2, VPC (subnets/route tables/security groups), ELB (NLB/ALB), S3 (buckets), EBS, Route53, etc.;</li><li><strong>Self-hosted Digital Systems</strong>: K8s clusters (Master/Worker nodes), middleware (Kafka/EMQ X), databases (MySQL/InfluxDB), application services (microservice containers), etc.;</li><li><strong>Core Monitoring Dimensions</strong>: Resource utilization (CPU/memory/disk/network), service availability (liveness/response latency), failure events (restarts/crashes/connection failures), performance metrics (QPS/throughput/query latency).</li></ul><h3>2. Design Principles</h3><ul><li>No Managed Dependencies: Only use AWS basic resources (EC2, VPC, ELB, S3, ASG, IAM, KMS), self-host all monitoring components;</li><li>High Availability Architecture: Multi-region (≥3) + multi-AZ (≥2 per region) deployment, no single point of failure;</li><li>Global Coverage: Cross-region metric aggregation,就近 access to monitoring panels, global latency &lt;1 second;</li><li>Lightweight Collection: Minimize collector resource consumption to avoid monitoring itself affecting business systems;</li><li>Fast Alerts: Fault detection → alert triggering ≤30 seconds, support multi-level alert routing.</li></ul><h2>2. Overall Layered Architecture Design</h2><h3>Architecture Overview</h3> <pre><code>Monitoring Targets (AWS Resources + Self-hosted Systems) → Metric Collection Layer (Self-deployed Collectors) → Transmission Forwarding Layer (Self-hosted Kafka) → Storage Analysis Layer (Prometheus + Thanos) → Visualization Alerting Layer (Grafana + Alertmanager)

</code></pre> <h2>3. Detailed Design of Each Layer (No Managed Service Dependencies)</h2><h3>(1) Metric Collection Layer: Comprehensive Data Collection, Full Coverage</h3><h4>Core Objective: Lightweight, Multi-source Collection, Adapted for AWS Resources + Self-hosted Systems</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Technology Selection (Purely Self-deployed)</strong>: - Resource Metric Collection: Node Exporter (system-level), AWS CLI custom scripts (AWS resources), cAdvisor (container-level); - Service Metric Collection: Blackbox Exporter (port/HTTP liveness), JMX Exporter (middleware), custom Exporters (databases/applications); - Collector Deployment: All collectors run as Docker containers on EC2 or K8s nodes, no managed collection service dependencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collection Scenarios</strong>:</p></li></ol><table><thead><tr><th>Monitoring Target</th><th>Collection Tool/Method</th><th>Core Metrics Collected</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AWS EC2/EBS</td><td>Node Exporter + AWS CLI scripts (timed AWS API calls)</td><td>CPU usage, memory usage, disk IO, network throughput, EBS read/write latency, instance status (running/stopped/restarted)</td></tr><tr><td>AWS VPC/Security Groups</td><td>Custom Shell scripts (timed verification of route table reachability, security group rule validity) + Route53 health checks</td><td>Available IPs in subnets, route table association status, security group port openness, VPC traffic drop rate</td></tr><tr><td>AWS ELB/S3</td><td>AWS CLI scripts (timed queries of ELB health status, S3 storage usage/success rate)</td><td>Healthy backend instances of ELB, request volume, response latency, S3 storage usage, PUT/GET success rate</td></tr><tr><td>Self-hosted K8s Cluster</td><td>cAdvisor + Kube-state-metrics (self-deployed)</td><td>Pod/Node resource usage, Pod restart count, Deployment replica readiness, Node readiness status</td></tr><tr><td>Middleware (Kafka/MySQL)</td><td>JMX Exporter (Kafka) + Custom SQL scripts (MySQL)</td><td>Kafka partition health, Topic backlog, MySQL connections, query latency, master-slave sync delay</td></tr><tr><td>Application Services</td><td>Custom Exporters (instrumentation exposure/log parsing)</td><td>Interface response time, error rate, QPS, thread pool status</td></tr></tbody></table><ol start="3"><li><strong>Collection Optimization</strong>: - Collection Frequency: Core metrics (CPU/memory/liveness status) every 10 seconds, non-core metrics (storage usage/S3 status) every 60 seconds; - Lightweight: Collector containers limited to CPU≤0.2vCPU, memory≤256MB to avoid occupying business resources; - Fault Tolerance: Cache metrics locally for 5 minutes when collection fails, batch upload upon recovery to avoid data loss.</li></ol><h3>(2) Transmission Forwarding Layer: Reliable, Low-latency Metric Flow</h3><h4>Core Objective: Peak shaving and valley filling, cross-region transmission, prevent metric</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Technology Selection</strong>: Self-hosted Kafka cluster (alternative to managed messaging services) + Kafka MirrorMaker (cross-region sync);</p></li><li><p><strong>Deployment Architecture</strong>: - Within Region: Deploy 1 EC2 (i3.large, local SSD) in each of 3 AZs as Kafka Brokers, 1 EC2 as ZooKeeper (3-node cluster), Topics configured with 3 replicas (cross-AZ); - Cross-region Sync: Deploy Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 to sync metric Topics from each region's Kafka to other regions, ensuring cross-region data consistency; - Topic Design: Split by metric type, such as <code>monitor/aws/ec2</code>, <code>monitor/system/k8s</code>, <code>monitor/middleware/kafka</code>, partitions per Topic = brokers in region;</p></li><li><p><strong>Key Guarantees</strong>: - Reliability: Kafka Topic data retention period 24 hours, supports metric replay; enable ACK=all to ensure data is written to all replicas before success; - Peak Shaving: Handle metric collection peaks (bulk reporting during system restarts), Kafka buffer queues prevent backend storage overload; | Encryption in Transit: Enable TLS 1.3 for Kafka node communication, SASL authentication + TLS encryption for collector→Kafka transmission.</p></li></ol><h3>(3) Storage Analysis Layer: Time-series Data Storage + Cross-region Aggregation</h3><h4>Core Objective: High-throughput writes, low-latency queries, long-term storage, global data aggregation</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Technology Selection</strong>: Self-hosted Prometheus cluster (real-time metrics) + Thanos (long-term storage + cross-region aggregation) + S3 (cold data archiving);</p></li><li><p><strong>Deployment Architecture</strong>: - Regional Prometheus: Deploy 1 highly available Prometheus cluster (2 Server nodes + shared storage) in each of 3 core regions (US East, EU West, Asia Pacific) to consume Kafka metrics via Kafka Adapter and write to Prometheus;</p><ul><li>Storage Configuration: Local SSD storage for hot data (last 7 days), write throughput supporting 100k metrics/sec;</li><li>High Availability: 2 Prometheus Servers with identical collection rules, data synchronized via Thanos Sidecar to avoid single point of failure;</li><li>Thanos Cluster (Cross-region Aggregation):</li><li>Thanos Query: Deploy 1 EC2 (m5.large) per region to receive Grafana queries, aggregating data from local + other regions' Prometheus;</li><li>Thanos Store Gateway: Deployed in S3-access-optimized region, interfacing with S3 cold data storage (metrics older than 7 days), supporting historical data queries;</li><li>Thanos Compactor: Periodically compress historical metrics in S3 to reduce storage costs;</li><li>Long-term Storage: Prometheus hot data migrated to S3 via Thanos Uploader after 7 days, S3 enables cross-region replication (sync to 2 backup regions), data retained for 90 days (configurable).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Query Optimization</strong>: - Metric Sharding: Shard storage by region + metric type, route queries only to target shards; - Cache Strategy: Thanos Query enables local caching (cache hotspot query results for 5 minutes) to reduce cross-region query latency; - Index Optimization: Prometheus enables inverted indexing to support fast filtering of metrics by resource ID (e.g., EC2 instance ID, K8s Pod name).</p></li></ol><h3>(4) Visualization Alerting Layer: Global Unified View + Real-time Alerts</h3><h4>Core Objective: Intuitive display, fast alerts, fault localization</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Technology Selection</strong>: Self-hosted Grafana (visualization) + Alertmanager (alerts) + Custom alert routing service;</p></li><li><p><strong>Deployment Architecture</strong>: - Grafana Cluster: Deploy 1 EC2 (t3.medium) in each of 3 regions, achieve global就近 access via NLB + Route53 intelligent DNS;</p><ul><li>Data Sources: Connect to all regions' Thanos Query, support "Global Overview - Regional Details - Resource Details" three-level dashboards;</li><li>Access Control: Enable LDAP authentication (self-hosted OpenLDAP cluster), divide resource access permissions by role (admin/ops/dev);</li><li>Alertmanager Cluster: Deploy 1 EC2 (t3.small) per region, associated with Prometheus cluster, support alert grouping, silencing, inhibition;</li><li>Alert Routing: Self-developed alert forwarding service (deployed in K8s), support pushing alerts to email, collaboration systems, and ticketing systems, route to different responsible parties by fault level (P0-P3).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Core Feature Adaptation</strong>: - Visualization Dashboards:</p><ul><li>Global Overview: AWS resource availability, system service health, TOP5 alert types by region;</li><li>Resource Details: Real-time metric curves for EC2/ELB/S3 (CPU/memory/traffic), abnormal metric marking;</li><li>Fault Troubleshooting: Correlated metrics + logs (integrated with self-hosted ELK cluster), support retrospective analysis of data before/after faults by time range;</li><li>Alert Rules:</li><li>P0 (Critical): Region-level service crashes (e.g., Kafka cluster unavailable), core EC2 instance offline &gt;30 seconds;</li><li>P1 (Severe): Resource utilization exceeding thresholds (CPU&gt;90% for 5 minutes), database connections exceeding limits;</li><li>P2 (Moderate): Non-critical service response delay &gt;1 second, S3 storage usage &gt;80%;</li><li>P3 (Info): Resource configuration nearing expiration, non-critical metric fluctuations.</li></ul></li></ol><h3>(5) Disaster Recovery and High Availability Layer: Seamless Failure Switching</h3><h4>Core Objective: Monitoring uninterrupted and data not lost during single-region failures</h4><ol><li><strong>Region-level Failover</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>Route53 Health Checks: Monitor availability of each region's Grafana and Thanos Query, automatically forward user requests to nearest healthy region when a region fails;</li><li>Data Redundancy: Kafka cross-region sync ensures metrics don't depend on single region, Prometheus hot data stored across AZs, S3 cold data backed up across regions;</li></ul><ol start="2"><li><strong>Service-level Self-healing</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>Collectors: Deployed in ASG, collector containers automatically restarted when EC2 nodes fail;</li><li>Kafka/Prometheus: Custom monitoring scripts (deployed on EC2) detect service status, automatically restart on failure, trigger ASG to scale new nodes if restart fails;</li><li>Databases (OpenLDAP/MySQL): Master-slave replication + Keepalived automatic switching, failover time &lt;10 seconds.</li></ul><h2>4. Core Monitoring Scenario Implementation</h2><h3>1. AWS Infrastructure Resource Health Monitoring</h3><ul><li>EC2 Fault Detection: Node Exporter collects instance status, Prometheus rules judge "instance status ≠ running" or "CPU usage = 0 and memory usage &lt; 10%", triggers P1 alert;</li><li>VPC Network Anomalies: Custom scripts periodically verify subnet route reachability, if failed 3 times consecutively, alert and push route table configuration snapshot;</li><li>S3 Availability Monitoring: AWS CLI scripts periodically perform S3 Put/GET operations, request success rate &lt; 99.99% or latency &gt; 500ms triggers P2 alert.</li></ul><h3>2. Self-hosted System Operation Monitoring</h3><ul><li>K8s Cluster Health: Kube-state-metrics collects Pod restart counts, triggers P1 alert if restarted &gt;3 times in 10 minutes; Node readiness status anomaly &gt;1 minute automatically triggers ASG to scale new nodes;</li><li>Kafka Fault Monitoring: JMX Exporter collects partition replica sync status, if "ISR replicas &lt; 2" or "Topic backlog &gt; 100k messages", triggers P0/P1 alerts;</li><li>Application Service Monitoring: Custom Exporter collects interface error rates, triggers P2 alert if error rate &gt;1% in 5 minutes, P1 alert and automatic application restart API call if error rate &gt;5%.</li></ul><h3>3. Fault Root Cause Localization</h3><ul><li>Metric Correlation: Grafana supports "resource metrics + service metrics" linked queries (e.g., EC2 CPU 100% → correlated K8s Pod resource usage → locate overloaded Pod);</li><li>Log Correlation: Self-hosted ELK cluster (EC2 deployed) collects system/application logs, Grafana embeds ELK query entry, can correlate metrics and logs by resource ID/time range for rapid fault cause identification.</li></ul><h2>5. Security and Compliance Design</h2><ol><li><strong>Data Security</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>Transmission Encryption: All links (collector→Kafka, Kafka→Prometheus, Grafana→Thanos) enable TLS 1.3;</li><li>Storage Encryption: EC2 disk EBS encryption, S3 buckets enable SSE-KMS encryption, Prometheus/MySQL data files encrypted;</li><li>Access Control: IAM roles limit EC2 access to AWS resources (e.g., only allow collector EC2 to call EC2/S3 APIs), Grafana/LDAP isolate monitoring data access permissions by role.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li><strong>Compliance Adaptation</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>Audit Logs: All monitoring operations (alert triggering, permission changes, dashboard modifications) logged, stored in S3 retained for 1 year, compliant with GDPR/CCPA audit requirements;</li><li>Data Masking: Hide sensitive information in monitoring metrics (e.g., EC2 instance passwords, database connection strings), retain only resource IDs, metric values and other necessary information.</li></ul><h2>6. Operations Automation Design (No Managed Ops Services)</h2><ol><li><strong>Infrastructure Orchestration</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>Terraform IaC: Write modular code to batch create EC2, VPC, ELB, Route53 and other basic resources, as well as deployment configurations for self-hosted components like Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana;</li><li>Environment Consistency: Differentiate dev/test/prod via Terraform workspaces, state files stored in S3 + DynamoDB locks to avoid configuration conflicts.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li><strong>Service Automated Operations</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>Custom Shell/Python Scripts: Monitor collector, Kafka, Prometheus operational status, automatically restart services on anomalies, trigger ASG to scale if restart fails;</li><li>Configuration Auto-sync: Sync all monitoring component config files (Prometheus rules, Grafana dashboards) via Git+Ansible, automatically distribute to all nodes after modification;</li><li>Version Upgrades: Use blue-green deployment model to upgrade monitoring components (e.g., Grafana/Prometheus), ensure monitoring uninterrupted during upgrades.</li></ul><h2>7. Core Metrics Assurance</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Metric Type</th><th>Target Value</th><th>Implementation Approach</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>System Availability</td><td>99.99% (annual downtime&lt;53 mins)</td><td>Multi-region + multi-AZ deployment, automatic failover, service multi-replica</td></tr><tr><td>Metric Collection Latency</td><td>&lt;30 seconds</td><td>Lightweight collectors, Kafka low-latency transmission</td></tr><tr><td>Alert Triggering Latency</td><td>&lt;30 seconds</td><td>Prometheus real-time rule evaluation, Alertmanager second-level forwarding</td></tr><tr><td>Cross-region Query Latency</td><td>&lt;1 second</td><td>Thanos aggregation, cache optimization</td></tr><tr><td>Data Retention Period</td><td>Hot data 7 days, cold data 90 days</td><td>Prometheus + S3 tiered storage</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Summary</h2><p>This architecture is completely self-hosted based on AWS basic resources, with no managed service dependencies. Through a closed-loop design of "comprehensive collection → reliable transmission → layered storage → global aggregation → real-time alerting", it achieves unified monitoring of AWS infrastructure resources and self-hosted digital systems. Multi-region + multi-AZ deployment guarantees 99.99% availability, cross-region data synchronization and access adapt to global business, lightweight collection and optimized storage balance performance and cost, fully satisfying global monitoring needs for "systems + cloud resources" while adapting to security compliance requirements of foreign enterprises.</p></main><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="footer-content"><div class="footer-section"><h3><i class="fas fa-snowflake"></i> Snowpeak</h3><p>Sharing and discussing cutting-edge technologies of AI and cloud computing, and other interesting topics.</p><div class="social-links"><div class="social-platforms"><a href="https://github.com/xfsnow" target="_blank" class="social-link"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a><a href="https://snowpeak.blog.csdn.net/" target="_blank" class="social-link"><i class="fas fa-blog"></i></a><a href="https://space.bilibili.com/701839928" target="_blank" class="social-link"><i class="fab fa-bilibili"></i></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/snowpeak" target="_blank" class="social-link"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></div><div class="wechat-section"><div class="wechat-info"><span class="wechat-label">WeChat Account</span><span class="wechat-name">Tech Warm Life</span></div><img src="/assets/img/techwarm.jpg" alt="Tech Warm Life" class="wechat-qr"></div></div></div><div class="footer-section"><h4>Quick Links</h4><ul><li><a href="/#articles">Article</a></li><li><a href="/#tools">Tools</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-section"><h4>Tech Stack</h4><ul><li>Python</li><li>GitHub Copilot</li><li>Claude Sonnet 4</li><li>HTML/CSS/JS</li><li>Responsive Design</li></ul></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>Copyright &copy; 2013-<script>document.write((new Date()).getFullYear());</script> Snowpeak Blog.
