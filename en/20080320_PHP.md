After learning the MVC pattern, plus data abstraction layer, I found that websites used only for front-end interaction can be further divided into multiple layers. Taking PHP as an example, it can be divided into the following structure.

| MVC | Specific Layer | Implementation Technology |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M Model | Business Process | PHP |
| Data Abstraction | PEAR DataObject |  |
| Database | MySQL |  |
| V View | Interface Language | Can use XML |
| Interface Style | CSS |  |
| Interface Structure | XHTML |  |
| C Controller |  |  |
