1. DVD copying

3. Converting graphical subtitles to text

5. If you want to add subtitle effects  
   Convert srt subtitle files to SSA or ASS subtitles, you can also use Subtitle Workshop to convert file formats, but for subtitle effects I always write them myself with a text editor program.  
   Recommended text editor program: UltraEdit.
