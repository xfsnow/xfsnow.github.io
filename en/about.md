Do you still remember the boy that was unwilling to fate 10 years ago? Although he studied English for many years, he had never quitted his dream of technology. The Internet opened a door for him and he had found a whole new work. He had vowed from his heart:

"I want to know the secrets behind the web pages!"

By now, the original goal has long been accomplished. He has grown into an experienced engineer of Internet application.

He is me.

For so many years, my non-technical educational background has been questioned constantly, which stimulates my endeavor. I have devoted all my passion and effort to those websites that I have made with various content, scale and even technology. I value them as my works, so I have perfected them continuously and meticulously.

They are records of my progress and they witness my glory and dream.

10 years can be a stage, but it is also a new start. Today, with all the techniques I have, I see a even wider world of Internet. I have the powers that I have been dreaming of. Now it’s time for me to usher a new future.





P.S. Have you seen my avatar? Actually he is my favorite anime character. I have chosen him, because he also has fate and pursuit to his dream in his stories. It seems that he is rarely used on the Net. So next time if you see him, that’s probably me.

P.P.S Do you know what character from which story my avatar is? If you know, Congratulations, you are probably my age peer. I’m afraid you are as similarly old as I am, because he comes from an old anime and you know him.
