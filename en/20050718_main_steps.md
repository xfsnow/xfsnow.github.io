## [Main Process and Tools for Extracting Subtitles from DVD](/en/article/detail/main_steps_and_tools_to_extract_subtitle_from_dvd/)

So far in my subtitle-making journey, I haven't found a single, all-in-one program that covers every function. This might be related to the complex and varied processes involved in creating subtitles. However, once you clarify the workflow and identify the right tools for each step, making good subtitles isn't actually that difficult. Moreover, because the tools for each step are highly specialized, these programs are often small, easy to install, and convenient to use.

Here is a brief introduction to each step and the software tools used.

1.  **Ripping the DVD**

    Use DVD Decrypter to get VOB files.

2.  **Extracting graphical subtitles from VOB files**

    Use VobSub to get the idx/sub paired graphical subtitle files.

3.  **Converting graphical subtitles to text format**

    Use SubOCR to get srt subtitle files.

4.  **Proofreading the subtitles**

    Use Subtitle Workshop to get accurately translated srt subtitle files.

5.  **Adding subtitle effects**

    Convert the srt subtitle file to SSA or ASS format. You can still use Subtitle Workshop to convert the file format, but for creating effects, I always use a text editor to write them by hand.
    For a text editor, I recommend UltraEdit.
