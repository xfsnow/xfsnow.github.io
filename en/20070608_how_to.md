## Methods to Remove Watermarks from PDF Files

The reason for removing watermarks from PDF files is not just because they make printed copies look messy, but more importantly:

1. When printed with watermarks, the text color in the document becomes lighter, making it hard to read.

2. Printing files with watermarks significantly increases the printing time.

The methods I successfully tested are as follows:

If using Adobe 8 Professional, open the file, go to `Document > Watermark > Remove`, and confirm whether to remove all watermarks. Select "Yes" to proceed. After removing the watermarks, the file size is indeed reduced, and the printing time is noticeably shortened.

If using Adobe 7 Professional, navigate to `Tools > Advanced Editing Tools > TouchUp Object Tool`, select the watermark object in the background, and delete it. To be safe, it is recommended to save the edited file under a new name.

If the PDF file has password restrictions, you can download the latest version of Ap PDF Password Recovery v3.0 to decrypt the PDF file first.
